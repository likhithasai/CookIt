Let's make a chicken stir fry today then.  
Heat the oil in a large frying pan or wok and fry the garlic and chicken, until browned all over. Add the pepper to the pan and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes.
Stir in the soy sauce, mangetout and chicken stock. Continue to stir-fry over a medium-high heat for 3-4 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Add in the cooked noodles and stir to combine.
